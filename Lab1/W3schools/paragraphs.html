<!-- 
HTML Paragraphs
The HTML <p> element defines a paragraph.

A paragraph always starts on a new line, and browsers automatically add some white space 
(a margin) before and after a paragraph.
-->

<!--
The browser will automatically remove any extra spaces and lines when the page is displayed:
-->
<p>
    This paragraph
    contains         a lot of spaces
    in the source         code,
    but the        browser
    ignores it.
</p>

<!--
The <hr> tag defines a thematic break in an HTML page, and is most often displayed as 
a horizontal rule.
-->


<!--The Poem Problem
This poem will display on a single line:-->
<p>
    My Bonnie lies over the ocean.
  
    My Bonnie lies over the sea.
  
    My Bonnie lies over the ocean.
  
    Oh, bring back my Bonnie to me.
  </p>

  <!--Solution - The HTML <pre> Element
The HTML <pre> element defines preformatted text.

The text inside a <pre> element is displayed in a fixed-width font (usually Courier), 
and it preserves both spaces and line breaks:-->
<pre>
    My Bonnie lies over the ocean.
  
    My Bonnie lies over the sea.
  
    My Bonnie lies over the ocean.
  
    Oh, bring back my Bonnie to me.
</pre>
