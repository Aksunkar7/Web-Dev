<!-- The HTML element is everything from the start tag to the end tag:

<tagname>Content goes here...</tagname>
Examples of some HTML elements:

<h1>My First Heading</h1>
<p>My first paragraph.</p> -->

The <br> tag defines a line break, and is an empty element without a closing tag:

<p>This is a <br> paragraph with a line break.</p>
