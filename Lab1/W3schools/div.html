<!--The <div> Element
The <div> element is by default a block element, meaning that it takes all available width, and comes with line breaks before and after.-->
    Lorem Ipsum <div>I am a div</div> dolor sit amet.
<!--Center align a <div> element
If you have a <div> element that is not 100% wide, and you want to center-align it, set the CSS margin property to auto.-->
    <style>
        div {
          width:300px;
          margin:auto;
        }
        </style>


<!--Float
The CSS float property was not originally meant to align <div> elements side-by-side, but has been used for this purpose for many years.

The CSS float property is used for positioning and formatting content and allows elements to be positioned horizontally, rather than vertically.

-->

<!--Flex
The CSS Flexbox Layout Module was introduced to make it easier to design flexible responsive layout structure without using float or positioning.

To make the CSS flex method work, surround the <div> elements with another <div> element and give it the status as a flex container.-->

    <style>
        .mycontainer {
          display: flex;
        }
        .mycontainer > div {
          width:33%;
        }
        </style>
