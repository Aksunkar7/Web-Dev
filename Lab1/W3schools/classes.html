<!--The class Attribute
The class attribute is often used to point to a class name in a style sheet. It can also be used by JavaScript to access and manipulate elements with the specific class name.

In the following example we have three <div> elements with a class attribute with the value of "city". All of the three <div> elements will be styled equally according to the .city style definition in the head section:-->
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
    <head>
    <style>
    .note {
      font-size: 120%;
      color: red;
    }
    </style>
    </head>
    <body>
    
    <h1>My <span class="note">Important</span> Heading</h1>
    <p>This is some <span class="note">important</span> text.</p>
    
    </body>
    </html> 

<!--Multiple Classes
HTML elements can belong to more than one class.

To define multiple classes, separate the class names with a space, e.g. <div class="city main">. The element will be styled according to all the classes specified.

In the following example, the first <h2> element belongs to both the city class and also to the main class, and will get the CSS styles from both of the classes: -->
    <h2 class="city main">London</h2>
<h2 class="city">Paris</h2>
<h2 class="city">Tokyo</h2>
